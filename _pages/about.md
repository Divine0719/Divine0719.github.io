I'm a postdoctoral fellow and assistant researcher at the School of Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Institute of Technology. I also serve as the director of the research department and a specially-appointed associate researcher at the Southeast Institute of Information Technology at Beijing Institute of Technology. My research interests include Multimodal Cognition and Computer Vision, and Large Language Model (LLM) Agents. I am looking for cooperation opportunities. If you are interested with my experience or research, please feel free to contact me via Email.
